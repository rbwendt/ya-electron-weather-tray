# Weather in your tray

Want to know the temperature and weather
conditions? Install this baby.

# Thoughts

- the nice tray icon comes from the
  [weather icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons)
  repo.
- edit `config.json` to put in the city
  weather page you want to scrape from
  environment Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- most of the magic here is thanks to
  electron, which I think is the platform
  that the atom text editor is built on,
  but don't quote me on that.
- the svgs from weather icons get converted
  to png in a headless chromium container. 
  What good is RAM if you don't use it.
- I don't expect anyone to actually use this,
  but I think I will.
